localBrowse
===========

A file manager+editor to run in the browser with Node.js

Is being ported to Node from the [PHP version](https://sourceforge.net/projects/localbrowse/).

Currently supports everything the PHP version did. Also has some improvements.

Feel free to submit a pull request, or make some issues for me to fix.

For list of things to be worked on, see [TODO.md](TODO.md).

For documentation, see [tree/jsdoc](jsdoc branch).
